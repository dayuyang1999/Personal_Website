To comfortably introduce Hawkes Process, first we have to understand some idea in Survival Analysis in Statistics.

<br><br>
<br><br>

# Survival Function

Assume T is a continuous random variable, it may represent "Length of Survival Time" of a patient.

Then, "the probability that this patient could live longer than t" is defined as `Survival Function` $S$:

$$
S(t)=\operatorname{Pr}\{T \geq t\}=1-F(t)=\int\_{t}^{\infty} f(x) d x
$$

<br><br>

# The Hazard Function

Then, the patient still survive at time point t, but he is still in danger of, say, heart failure. How could we quantify the "seriousness" of his condition? 

We define the instantaneous rate of occurrence of the event as `hazard function`:

$$
\lambda(t)=\lim \_{d t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\operatorname{Pr}\{t \leq T<t+d t \mid T \geq t\}}{d t}
$$

- a rate of event occurrence per unit of time
  - The numerator of this expression is the conditional probability that the event will occur in the interval $[t,t+dt)$ given that it has not occurred before
  -  the denominator is the width of the interval
- Taking the limit as the width of the interval goes down to zero, we obtain an **instantaneous** rate of occurrence.
- The overall term is not a probability, since the it is not actually a probability because it can exceed 1.



<br><br>

Recall the conditional probability formula:

$$Pr(A|B) = \frac{Pr(AB)}{Pr(B)}$$

- For the numerator, it is the joint probabiliry that $T$ is in the interval $[t,t+dt)$ and $T \ge t$ (which is the same as the probability that t is in the interval):

  - $$P(t \leq T<t+d t ,\; T \geq t) = P(t \leq T<t+d t)$$
  - When $dt$ is a small interval:
    - $$P(t \leq T<t+d t)=\int\_{t}^{t+dt} f(x)dx \approx f(t)\times dt$$


- For the denumerator:
  - $P(T \ge t) = S(t) =1-F(t)$



Overall : the harzard function could be write as:



$$\lambda(t) = \frac{\frac{f(t)dt}{1-F(t)}}{dt} = \frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$$

In sum: 

the rate of the **first occurrence** of the event at duration t (`harzard function`), equals the density of events at t, divided by the probability of surviving to that duration without experiencing the event.

Note that:


$$S'(t) = - f(t)$$

So it's able to rewrite harzard function as:

$$\lambda(t) = -\frac{d}{d t} \log S(t) $$


if we integrate from $0$ to $t$ for both side:

$$\int\_{0}^{t} \lambda(u) du = - (logS(t) - logS(0))$$

Since $S(0) =  P(T>0) = 1$, can be simplied as:

$$\int\_{0}^{t} \lambda(u) du = - logS(t)$$

---
Note:

What if now we are now just pass $t_k$, and the patient still survive. (We have already know the event did not happened during [0, t]).

We could take the integral from $t_k$ to $t$ intead of $0$ to $t$:

The result is 

$$\int\_{0}^{t} \lambda(u) du = - (logS(t) - logS(t_k))$$

Similarily, we already know there's no event happened before $t_k$, that means $S(t_k) = Pr(T>t_k)=1$

We could still remove the late term $logS(t_k)$

---

This is equavalent to:

$$S(t) = \exp\left(-\int_0^t \lambda(x)dx\right)$$


- the integral term is called `the cumulative hazard` (or cumulative risk):
  - $$\Lambda(t)=\int\_{0}^{t} \lambda(x) dx$$
    - You may think of $Î›(t)$ as the sum of the risks you face going from duration 0 to t.



We could also obtain the relation between `hazard function`  with the distribution of T:

$$
F^{*}(t)=1-\exp \left(-\int_{t_{k}}^{t} \lambda^{*}(u) \mathrm{d} u\right), \quad f^{*}(t)=\lambda^{*}(t) \exp \left(-\int_{t_{k}}^{t} \lambda^{*}(u) \mathrm{d} u\right)
$$



# Some Useage 

## Expectation of Life

$$
\mathbb{E}(T)=\int_{0}^{\infty} u f(u) d u
$$

the expectation of life could also be obtain from `survival function`:

use "integrating by part":
$$
\int u d v=u v-\int v d u
$$

the former could be write as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int u f(u) d u &=-\int u d S(u) \\
&=-\left.\left(u s(u)-\int s(u) d n\right)\right|\_{0} ^{\infty} \\
&=\int\_{0}^{\infty} S(u) d u
\end{aligned}
$$

The `harzard function` here is the `Conditional Intensity Function` we gonna talk later.
